## Configure Jenkins to retrieve source codes from GitHub using Webhooks
> Enable webhooks in your GitHub repository settings
> Go to Jenkins web console, click "New Item" and create a "Freestyle project"
> Connect to your GitHub repositoryby providing its URL to your Jinkins web console.
> In configuration of your Jenkins freestyle project choose Git repository, provide there the link to your Tooling GitHub repository and credentials (user/password) so Jenkins could access files in the repository
> Run a build manually by clicking on Buildnow. You should get the following result.

## CONFIGURE JENKINS TO COPY FILES TO NFS SERVER VIA SSH
> Now we have our artifacts saved locally on Jenkins server, the next step is to copy them to our NFS server to /mnt/apps directory. To do this, we have to install the 'Publish Over SSH' plugin.

> Save this configuration and go ahead, change something in README.MD file in your GitHub Tooling repository.
>Webhook will trigger a new job and in the "Console Output" of the job you should see the following result:
